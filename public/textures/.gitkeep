# Textures Directory

This directory is a placeholder for texture files for the 3D floor plan renderer.

In the current implementation, we're using dynamically generated textures created with HTML Canvas
instead of loading external image files. This approach avoids issues with missing texture files
and reduces the overall application size.

If you want to use actual image textures in the future, you could place them here:
- floor-wooden.jpg
- floor-tile.jpg
- floor-marble.jpg
- floor-concrete.jpg
- floor-carpet.jpg
- wall-white.jpg
- wall-beige.jpg
- wall-gray.jpg
- wall-brick.jpg
- wall-wallpaper.jpg
